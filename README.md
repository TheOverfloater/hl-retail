# hl-retail
 Half-Life : Retail was a project to add back the features of the original Half-Life as it was at the time of the first retail release. Over time it evolved into something a bit different, and adds new features like per-vertex lighting on models and stencil shadows. Per-vertex lighting is added by comparing the lights.rad file used by hlrad to the geometry and texture info of the BSP file. This mod also adds stencil shadows without the need for a hacked DLL or any engine function hooks. For more on this, check svd_render.cpp.
